Concatenative programming language.
At the moment, it has a very unoptimized code. I do not advise you to take any ideas / solutions from here. The version that is currently relevant for this repository is not written for the purpose of any adequate implementation. At the moment I am writing a new code that will at least have an adequate byte code and translation into a cleaner Rust code, without the hardcode of stack operations in process of transpilation.
